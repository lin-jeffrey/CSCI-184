    "## Homework 4\n",
    "*For any questions or concerns please email your instructor at `smanna@scu.edu`*\n",
    "### Due - 05/29/2020 - 11:59p - 20 points\n",
    "\n",
    "**Name:** `<Jeffrey Lin>`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Email** `<jlin7@scu.edu>`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives:** \n",
    "* Make you conversant with word embedding using word2vec\n",
    "* Familiarity with `gensim`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement:** \n",
    "You are given some amazon reviews on `Musical Instruments`. Your task is to clean your data, separate out sentences, and then use them to train your `word2vec` model. After your model is trained, then you have to compute the following:\n",
    "* print top 10 words based on term frequency (make sure they are not stop-words)\n",
    "* print `most similar` top 5 words for each of the above words\n",
    "* randomly pick 10 words, and print their `similarity` in the format: `similarity between a and b is ____`. If $sim(a,b) = sim(b,a)$, then you should print only one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission Instructions:** \n",
    "* Please download `hw4.ipynb` and `reviews_Musical_Instruments_5.json` and insert cells in the `hw4.ipynb` to complete your homework and submit the same file to Camino under `Homework` $\\rightarrow$ `hw4`.\n",
    "* Please make sure you type your `Name` and `Email` on top of your submission file in the placeholder above. \n",
    "* Feel free to use your in-class examples `w7-TextProcessing.ipynb` and `w8-word2Vec.ipynb` to work on this homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset:** The original [data](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/) contains reviews from amazon on `Musical Instruments`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Honor Code:** You are expected to complete the homework on your own. Solutions might exist elsewhere, but you are not allowed to copy them. "

       " u'now my recordings are much more crisp.',\n",
       " u\"it is one of the lowest prices pop filters on amazon so might as well buy it, they honestly work the same despite their pricing, The product does exactly as it should and is quite affordable.I did not realized it was double screened until it arrived, so it was even better than I had expected.As an added bonus, one of the screens carries a small hint of the smell of an old grape candy I used to buy, so for reminiscent's sake, I cannot stop putting the pop filter next to my nose and smelling it after recording.\",\n",
       " u':DIf you needed a pop filter, this will work just as well as the expensive ones, and it may even come with a pleasing aroma like mine did!Buy this product!',\n",
       " u':] The primary job of this device is to block the breath that would otherwise produce a popping sound, while allowing your voice to pass through with no noticeable reduction of volume or high frequencies.',\n",
       " u'The double cloth filter blocks the pops and lets the voice through with no coloration.',\n",
       " u'The metal clamp mount attaches to the mike stand secure enough to keep it attached.',\n",
       " u'The goose neck needs a little coaxing to stay where you put it.',\n",
       " u'Nice windscreen protects my MXL mic and prevents pops.',\n",
       " u'Only thing is that the gooseneck is only marginally able to hold the screen in position and requires careful positioning of the clamp to avoid sagging.',\n",
       " u'This pop filter is great.',\n",
       " u'It looks and performs like a studio filter.',\n",
       " u\"If you're recording vocals this will eliminate the pops that gets recorded when you sing.\",\n",
       " u'So good that I bought another one.',\n",
       " u'Love the heavy cord and gold connectors.',\n",
       " u'Bass sounds great.',\n",
       " u'I just learned last night how to coil them up.',\n",

       " u'But no harm done, still works great!',\n",
       " u'I have used monster cables for years, and with good reason.',\n",
       " u'The lifetime warranty is worth the price alone.',\n",
       " u\"Simple fact: cables break, but getting to replace them at no cost is where it's at.\",\n",
       " u'I now use this cable to run from the output of my pedal chain to the input of my Fender Amp.',\n",

       " u'You cant go wrong with Monster Cables.',\n",
       " u'Monster makes a wide array of cables, including some that are very high end.',\n",
       " u\"I initially purchased a pair ofMonster Rock Instrument Cable - 21 Feet - Angled to Straight 1/4-Inch plugto use with my keyboards, but when it came time to purchase cables for my bass and guitar I thought I'd pinch a few pennies.\",\n",
       " u'I am so glad I did.I compared this cable model to the more expensive models I previously purchased and, aside from looks, could not detect any difference in sound.',\n",
       " u'I Swapped back and forth between my guitars and keyboards, ensuring that each model was used on each instrument - still no difference.What the more expensive model has going for it is looks.',\n",
       " u'I am not sure it (the higher priced model) is even more sturdy because the molded stress relief ends on this model seem to make it more reliable than its pricier sibling.Bottom line: carefully compare both cables using your own instrument and amp - if possible - before making a purchase decision.',\n",
       " u'You may find, as I did, that higher price does not necessarily equal higher value, even from the same manufacturer.',\n",
       " u'I got it to have it if I needed it.',\n",
       " u\"I have found that i don't really need it that often and rarely use it.\",\n",
       " u'If I was really good I can see the need.',\n",
       " u'But this is a keyboard not an organ.',\n",
       " u'If you are not use to using a large sustaining pedal while playing the piano, it may appear little awkward.',\n",
       " u'I love it, I used this for my Yamaha ypt-230 and it works great, I would recommend it to anyone I bought this to use in my home studio to control my midi keyboard.',\n",
       " u'It does just what I wanted it to do.',\n",
       " u'I bought this to use with my keyboard.',\n",
       " u\"I wasn't really aware that there were other options for keyboard pedals.\",\n",
       " u\"It doesn't work as smoothly as the pedals do on an acoustic piano, which is what I'd always used.\",\n",
       " u\"Doesn't have the same feel either.\",\n",
       " u'Nowhere close.In my opinion, a sustain pedal like the M-Audio SP-2 Sustain Pedal with Piano Style Action or other similar pedal is a much better choice.',\n",
       " u'The price difference is only a few dollars and the feel and action are so much better.',\n",
       " u\"The only thing I've found the Yamaha FC-5 Sustain Pedal is good for is taking up space in a drawer where I keep my electric guitar pedals.\",\n",
       " u'This Fender cable is the perfect length for me!',\n",
       " u\"Sometimes I find it a bit too long but I don't mind.\",\n",
       " u'The build quality is great and I know that it will last.',\n",
       " u'The only gripe I have with this cable is that the metal sleeve gets unscrewed way too easily, requiring me to tighten it often.Sound quality is not affected, and the color is cool, definitely try this cable out.',\n",
       " u'wanted it just on looks alone...It is a nice looking cord...',\n",
       " u'I know it will perform...as for Sam Ash ...this cord was packed in a mailer inside another box with my Roc n Soc... his shipping team do great work..never any complaints from me...',\n",
       " u\"I love Sam Ash.. thanks Amazon I've been using these cables for more than 4 months and they are holding up pretty well.\",\n",
       " u'For years I used seemingly indestructable guitar cables that were made for me by an electrician friend.',\n",
       " u'When they finally gave out, I got in the habit of using the no-name cables that are always on display near the register at Guitar Center- really more of an impulse buy than something I put any thought into.',\n",
       " u'After the third or fourth Guitar Center cable failed from light use I decided to try these cables.',\n",
       " u'Not only are they cheaper but they seem to be holding up better.',\n",
       " u'I am not terribly hard on my gear but my cables tend to get twisted as I move around and the cheaper ones  eventually fail mid-cable.',\n",
       " u\"I don't mind spending a few extra dollars if the cable is a little more durable.\",\n",
       " u\"This cable is actually cheaper- $12 or so shipped- and it's holding up pretty well.\",\n",
       " u\"These are actually very reasonably priced for 18' cables.\",\n",
       " u\"There is some kind of limited life warantee on this product but I haven't needed it.\",\n",
       " u\"Five stars for a nicely made 18 foot guitar cable that costs $12 shipped!Incidentally- these cables are shielded and are meant to connect your instrument to your amp's input.\",\n",
       " u'Do not use these to connect an amplifier to a speaker cab.',\n",
       " u'You want to use unshielded cables for that purpose.Edit-  More than 6 months has passed and this cable is functioning without any issues.',\n",
       " u'The price on these things has gone up significantly and although the cable is highly recommended, there are probably better values from Hosa, Monster or Planet Waves- Fender cords look great and work just as well.',\n",
       " u\"By adding the word California to the description I'm sure to sound like the Beach Boys...\",\n",
       " u'This is a cool looking cheap cable which works well.',\n",
       " u'I bent one of the connectors pretty badly but that was my fault.',\n",
       " u'One thing to consider with the cable is to tighten the connectors once in awhile.',\n",
       " u\"You'll be able to hear them rattle.\",\n",
       " u\"It seems that the 'retro' look is screw on connectors over some black rubber, but other than that, the cable looks cool and works well.I also have the shorter red cable which goes with one of my guitars perfectly.\",\n",
       " u'I bought theses to use while practicing with others who use black cables.',\n",
       " u\"It's easier to plug into different amps without cutting someone out by accident.\",\n",
       " u'The green cable is good for that.',\n",
       " u'The Fender 18 Feet California Clear Instrument Cable - Lake Placid Blue  is a very good extra cord for a good price.',\n",
       " u'Very good cable.',\n",
       " u'Well made and it looks great with my Candy Apple Red Tele.',\n",
       " u'The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because it tends not to lay flat on the floor.',\n",
       " u'Got this cable to run a rockband keyboard controller to my M-audio profire 2626 to control midi in Pro Tools.',\n",
       " u'Works great!',\n",
       " u'Firm fit, solidly molded ends, reputable branded cable.',\n",
       " u\"(a bit on the thin side, but i haven't seen to have any issue due to this or anything.\",\n",
       " u\"Couldn't go wrong for $5 at the time of my purchase and prime eligibility.\",\n",
       " u'When I was searching for MIDI cables for my ART X-15 foot controller, I came across these Hosa ones, and they were $2 dollars each!',\n",
       " u'As they are now $6, I realize I would still be happy with that price as well, as they are high quality plastic and metal connectors, and work flawlessly.',\n",
       " u'You must realize that they are only 5 feet, as I overestimated it and now wish they were longer.',\n",
       " u'For any connection from racked sound modules, this will be perfect.',\n",
       " u'Cant go wrong.',\n",
       " u'Great quality on a budget price  - Hosa is the go to when you need to hook things up The ends of the midi cable look and feel like quality.',\n",

       " u'Highly recommended.',\n",
       " u'Just trying to find a midi to midi was a task, and you have to make sure the pin config is correct.',\n",
       " u'This one is a good product and works just fine The Hosa XLR cables are affordable and very heavily made.I have a large mixer and rack and cables everywhere.I decided to purchase shorter cables and the Hosa cables 5ft measurement worked perfectly.You really will not be disappointed with these.',\n",
       " u'I bought these to go from my board to the amp.',\n",
       " u'We use them for a mobile church so they take a beating.',\n",

       " u'Hosa products are a good bang for the buck.',\n",
       " u\"I haven't looked up the specifications, but I'm guessing the wire is 22 to 24 AWG, but since it's only 10' long, it's good enough.\",\n",
       " u'This was exactly what I was after.',\n",
       " u'I have a voice touch and needed a small cord to connect the mic to the voice touch and this was perfect.',\n",
       " u'Before I used a 20 foot cord to go about 12 inches.',\n",
       " u'I highly recommend this for those who keep the mic on a stand and have a voice touch or other stand connected device for vocals.',\n",
       " u'I bought these because I really had too long of mike cords for my solo live show.',\n",
       " u'And these are really nice cords if you have a home portastudio recording studio like myself.',\n",
       " u'Who needs all the spaghetti to trip on all over the place?',\n",
       " u'I bought two because I use a Digitech Live 2 Harmony processor and two XLR mike cords are required to make it operational.',\n",
       " u'Good price here too.',\n",
       " u\"Hard to find just 10' mike cords.\",\n",
       " u'Usually longer ones are only obtainable.',\n",
       " u'This cable seems like it will last me for a while.',\n",
       " u'As it is only being used to connect a DI box it will not get abused as much as the vocal mics always do.',\n",
       " u\"These are not the greatest but they're cheap and they get to you fast when you need them.\",\n",
       " u\"I've only had one fail and I've bought many of them to use in our broadcast studio.Amazon is the first place I go when I need cables for audio, video, computers or concert lighting.Good music to all!\",\n",

       " u\"I've used a lot of cables and I always come back to HOSA, they are indeed some of the best audio cables in their price range on the market.\",\n",
       " u\"I bought this cord after returning a cheap one that I should've known better than to buy.\",\n",
       " u'My son, who has some experience as a musician recommended the Hosa brand when I was seeking a proper replacement.I bought it for a small home recording setup which includes a Behringer C-1 Condenser Microphone and a Behringer Xenyx 302 Mixer, and both ends make a reliable connection to both the board and the mic; the sound quality is excellent.An excellent value for the money.',\n",

       " u\"The end design chosen uses the single set screw connector (the tiny one that gets lost so easy if you need to take it apart) and the rubber bumper design on the back which I haven't had the best of luck making quick changes in the field with, however for interconnecting equipment on a temporary basis these cables are an important starting point of any audio engineer's kit because they will be used not if but WHEN the need arises.Another favorite of mine is the 6 pack of 3 foot male to female cables which do use my favorite XLR ends mentioned above, which amazon will rush you:GLS Audio 3ft Patch Cable Cords - XLR Male To XLR Female Black Cables - 3' Balanced Snake Cord - 6 PACK- these are very easy to open an end, change phase, lift ground, or input someone's oddball source signal.\",\n",
       " u\"Having 6 on hand means you won't quibble over cable costs before the show starts and that channel will be in the final mix.Back to pyle's product here, I basically took away 1 star for not using the easy to open and re-wire XLRs but gave them a star for value in the product since it's 15 feet long and will reach between my mixer and most anything else inside the booth for under a buck a foot.\",\n",

       " u\"For the price they have saved many installations from being torn up or rewired which means no surprises opening the next showing.I finally equipped my cable kit with the usual XLR to  RCA, 1/4 TRS, hi-z transformers, and the above mentioned 6 pack of 3 foot cables to quickly gain access to the XLR terminals if need be, plus 2 of these 15 foot cables mainly to solve distance problems, and a roll of gaffer's tape for good measure to prevent tripping hazards.\",\n",
       " u'I used to have 2ea 50 foot XLR cables but no sooner than the box was opened one became a permanent addition to the stage snake so now I have one left for my kit.',\n",
       " u'With all that I had to build an emergency XLR to 2.5mm TS all metal shielded connector for a mike input on short notice so a soldering kit with misc plugs got added to my cable bin.',\n",
       " u'Even though all this was under $100 it has saved the day more than once and made the show go on, so a bit of \"what if\" thinking and judicial purchases can make you look like the miracle mixer in the black painted room and justify your existance when the owner\\'s daugher\\'s toy musicbox becomes a channel in the house mix thanks to some quick cable magic.My last cable advice is never deconstruct something you custom made.',\n",
       " u\"It will no doubt be needed again, and since you made it you'll know why, how, and where it was used before, thus you save time not recreating a past fix rather pulling it from your magic box of tricks and solving the problem.\",\n",

       " u'I chalked that up to being part of the intended musical signal, wondering just how much it hurt to play with all the piercings scraping along the harmonica when I setup my monitor speakers to listen to just that (stereo) channel in rehersal at the console.',\n",
